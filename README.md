# TheMagicConchBot
Responds to any twitter mention with a response from the Magic Conch Shell, as seen on Spongebob Squarepants season 3, episode 42!


## How it works
All you have to do is tweet @ the account @Magic_ConchBot, from a public Twitter account, and wait for your response!


## What's inside?
This project was created using Python (scripts and twitter api logic), Docker, and AWS!

### Additional notes:
###### This repository will not feature the environment variables file, as it exposes twitter api keys. Please contact me if you have any questions!
